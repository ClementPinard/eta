An open and extensible video analytics infrastructure.

This project is supported by the NIST Public Safety Innovation Accelerator
Program.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/voxel51/eta
cd eta/
```

If you want to simply install the toolkit and use it, run

```shell
pip install .
```

Now `import eta` will work from anywhere, and you can delete the directory you
just cloned.

If you want to install the project in development mode, run

```shell
pip install -e .
```

Now `import eta` will still work from anywhere, and any changes you make in
your local copy of `eta/` will take effect immediately.

pip uninstall eta
```
